            Hi!ðŸ‘‹ This is an IPL match win Probability Predictor Web Application. By using Machine Learning 
            I build this Web Application. It is capable of predicting the probability of any ongoing match Winner. 
            By taking some information about current scenario of the match as an input. After providing the information 
            required to predict the probability. It will show the Probability of win the match for both teams based on all 
            previous record.</h6>''',unsafe_allow_html=True)
